# Sorting Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of classic sorting algorithms in C.  
Each algorithm is implemented in its own file for clarity, along with a `test.c` file to demonstrate usage.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Selection_Sort.c` â†’ Implementation of **Selection Sort** (minimum-based).
- `max_selection_sort.c` â†’ Implementation of **Selection Sort** (maximum-based).
- `bubble_sort.c` â†’ Implementation of **Bubble Sort** (with optimization).
- `insertion_sort.c` â†’ Implementation of **Insertion Sort**.
- `test.c` â†’ A menu-driven program that lets you input an array and choose which sorting algorithm to apply.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Compile any file you want to test. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc Selection_Sort.c -o selection
   ./selection
